## üì¶ Download

We use [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/artisanat) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/artisanat) to publish **stable builds** of Artisanat for Minecraft.

You can download the latest stable builds from both pages without signing up for an account, although [downloading on CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/artisanat) is currently preferred.

### Required mods
