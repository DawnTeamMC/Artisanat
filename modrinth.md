Artisanat adds a ton of new decorative blocks, such as new bricks, stained dark prismarine, more concrete/terracotta blocks and flower piles.

Artisanat requires [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/), [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and [Dawn API](https://modrinth.com/mod/dawn)
